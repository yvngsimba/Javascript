    // Math 3
    // In the final task for this article, we want you to write some tests. There are three groups, each consisting of a statement and two variables.
    // For each one, write a test that proves or disproves the statement made. Store the results of those tests in variables called weightComparison, heightComparison, and pwdMatch, respectively.

    //Statement 1:A pile of bricks weights less than a pile of feathers (lb)
    const bricks = 1000;
    const feathers = 1;

    let weightComparison = bricks < feathers;
      console.log(weightComparison) 

    //Statement 2: A Jaguar Xf is faster than a Audi R8 (mph)
    const jaguar = 149;
    const audi = 200;

    let topSpeed = jaguar > audi;
    console.log(topSpeed)

    //Statement 3: The 2 variables share the same pattern
    const firstPattern = "XoXo";
    const secondPattern = "XoXo";

    let same = firstPattern === secondPattern
    console.log(same)
